# CSS-HTML

# Welcome to my HTML and CSS projects repository!

Here you will find a collection of projects that I've created to showcase my skills and experience with web development.

All of the projects in this repository make use of **HTML** and **CSS** to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. I have used the latest standards and best practices to ensure that the code is clean, readable, and maintainable.

In these projects, you will find examples of my work with:

- **HTML5**: I have used the latest version of HTML to create the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: I have used CSS to style the web pages, including layout, typography, and color.
- **Responsive design**: I have used media queries and other techniques to ensure that the web pages look good on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.
- **Accessibility**: I have considered accessibility best practices in my HTML and CSS code to make the web pages usable for as many people as possible.

I hope that you find these projects to be interesting and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
